RGB Pi Project

This is a simple Python script used to controle an RGB strip.
The hardware guide i used: https://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/

This script provides multiple modes and settings for those modes. The modes provide different colour patterns / transitions. I am still working on adding more.

Currently whats complete is:
-Command System.
-Settings.
-Controller.
-Visualiser.

I am planning to add a web server to control the program remotely.

The Visualiser is intended to speed up the process of creating patterns and testing them. So you can visually see what would happen.

Why?: I wanna learn how to create lights and lighting systems for Live events. I wanna create a custom light fixture from scratch and control it using DMX. Alongside this i wanna create a Laser system similar to Pangolin or Laser world laser systems.

Also improve my electronics and software understanding this is technically my second project that used software to control hardware. The last one i did was all the way back at school. lol.

I am planning to do an addressible LED strip next. I maybe intergrate the controller for that project into this one. However this is only able to control none addressible LED strips from my understanding.
