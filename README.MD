RGB Pi Project

This is a simple Python script used to controle an RGB strip.
The hardware guide i used: https://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/

This script provide a mode and settings for each mode. All the modes provide different colour patterns / transitions. I am still working on adding more.

Currently whats complete is:
-Command System.
-Settings.
-Controller.
-Visualiser.

I am planning to add a web server to this program so you can use your browser to control the RGB strip.

The Visualiser is intended to speed up the process of creating patterns and testing them. So you can visually see what would happen.

Why?: I wanna learn how to create lights and lighting systems for Live events. I wanna create a light fixture from scratch and controle it using DMX. Alongside this i wanna create a Laser system similar to Pangolin or Laser world lasers. Create these units entirely from scratch.

Also improve my electronic to software understanding this is technically my second project that used software to control hardware. The last i did was all the way back at school. lol.

I am planning to do an addressible LED strip next. I maybe incorpreated into this project. However this is only able to controle none addressible LED strips from my understanding.
